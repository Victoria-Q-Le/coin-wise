# COIN WISE

The site is live at [Coin Wise](https://coin-wise.netlify.app/).

## What is it? 

This app is a full stack app using React and MUI for front end, and Firebase at backend server. The app features many useful dependencies to help user gather information regarding their interested crypto currencies such as the market cap, price and price fluctuation in selected time frame



### Home Page 

The Home page contains 2 main sections: 
    - Banner: with an autoplay carousel that display 10 most popular crypto currencies including their prices, symbol as well as their changes in the past 24 hours. 
    - Coin table: provides information for 100 different crypto currencies. Also comes with a search box so user can easily look up for any currency the want. 

### Coin page

Once click on any currency, users will be directed to the coin page of that specific coin. In this page users can find useful insights regarding the coin such as:
    - Coin information 
    - Chart that reflects the price changes of that coin during selected time frame 

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
